# Magisk modules

This project contains scripts and patches to build modules for the
[Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) android root solution.

The idea is to simplify the automatic update of modules whenever new
source code for them is released.

Note that all modules are cross-compiled.

## Directory Structure

- [docs](docs/):

  all currently available modules.
